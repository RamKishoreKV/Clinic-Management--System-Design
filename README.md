## 🚀 Project Overview

**Smart Clinic** is a cost-effective, user-friendly patient management system designed specifically for small clinics struggling with paper-based or overly complex hospital-grade solutions. Our goal was to design a scalable, secure, and modular web-based system for managing patients, appointments, medical records, and payments—while keeping the experience intuitive for clinic staff.

This project demonstrates our comprehensive understanding of **systems analysis and design**, incorporating UML modeling, use case design, and structured documentation techniques. It showcases both business-driven design and technical accuracy expected in real-world healthcare systems.
